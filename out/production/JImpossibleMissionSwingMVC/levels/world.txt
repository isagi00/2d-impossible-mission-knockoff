this is the game world. i want it to like load the corresponding level once the player reaches the right side or door of the current level.
so the first line is the surface, where i would like to start the player off from the tutorial.

t1 t2 t3 el ex el ex
      lv el lv el
      lv el lv el
      lv el lv el
      lv el lv el
//progressively harder rooms, with better prizes (chances of finding better items)

where t1,t2,t3 is the tutorial levels,
el is the elevator,
lv is a level, where sometimes it spawns and sometimes it does not... like there will be a closed or open door,
and this level is casually selected between 1 - 8 levels, and if it appears once, it cant appear again in the game world.

a level, like lv or t1 is defined as
